You're doing a fine job, soldier.[N]
I leave the border's defenses to you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yes, milord![A][X]

##EldiganEvans
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadEldigan]
Sigurd![N]
It's been a long time.[A][N]
Pray tell, why do I find you suddenly occupying[N]
Evans?[A][N]
You couldn't possibly be declaring war[N]
on Verdane, could you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Eldigan![N]
Am I glad to see you.[A][N]
Listen. The Verdanites have abducted[N]
Lady Edain of Yngvi.[A][N]
They've made it amply clear that they[N]
don't plan on releasing her.[A][N]
Taking her back by force is our only option.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, I see.[N]
That makes sense.[A][N]
Well, whatever you do,[N]
you cannot afford to leave Evans unattended.[A][N]
My fellow Agustrian lords have been of a[N]
rancorous sort of late[...][A][N]
Ah, I know.[N]
I'll ensure they don't threaten you from behind.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm sorry to involve you in this as well.[A][N]
Say, Eldigan, once I'm done here,[N]
what do you say to a catch up?[A][N]
You, me, a fine bottle of wine[...][N]
Just like old times.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Mm. I'm looking forward to it.[N]

Eldigan, thanks for coming![A][N][OpenFarRight]
You're right, Eldigan, it[N]
has been far too long.[A][N]
When was the last time[N]
all three of us gathered?[A][N]
Wasn't it your coronation?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah yes[...] that was a fun day, but[N]
Quan, we have some things to discuss[A][N]

Let's meet up when this is all[N]
over. Just the three of us.[A][N]
We'll find a cozy little spot,[N]
have a little wine[...][A][N]
Just like old times.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

to spew bile like that![A][N]
I'm not about to make an enemy outta someone[N]
with a sword arm as fine as yours.[A][N]
I can promise you that.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][OpenMidRight]

##ArdenAlecTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlec][OpenMidRight][LoadArden]
I was a little concerned[N]
about crossing the border[A][N]

At least, I think so.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Shucks. That means a lot.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

We've dealt with Cimbaeth.[N]
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]

You needn't keep fighting.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What? You saved Shannan?[N]
Do you speak the truth?![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I do. Prince Shannan told me everything:[A][N]
that you're the daughter of the late Isaachian[N]
king.[A][N]
Listen. You detest Grannavalians.[N]

But you can't neglect your duty to the prince.[A][N]
You can't afford to waste your life now,[N]
not on a battle senseless as this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
My brother, the crown prince, entrusted Shannan[N]
to my care knowing that his death was inevitable.[A][N]
You're right. After all this time,[N]
I refuse to die for Verdane's sake.[A][N]
Until I've seen Shannan rise to the Isaachian[N]
throne, my life is not mine to forfeit to such dogs.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I will aid you all I can, if you lower your sword.[A][N]
On my honor as the heir of Baldr the Crusader,[N]
I swear I will not betray you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. I'll place my trust in you, as well[...][N]
Such is the way of the warriors of Isaach.[A][N]
For now, I pledge my blade in your service.[A][N]
However, this does not change that Grannavale[N]
is my foe.[A][N]
Beware, for if one day that includes you[...][N]

Say, Edain[...], As I recall,[A][N]
you declined to pursue a knighthood and[N]
instead joined the clergy. Am I right?[A][N]
I shouldn't be surprised, knowing how easily[N]
people warm to you, and you to them.[A][N]
I'd do well to learn from your example.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you, Lord Sigurd,[N]
but that isn't exactly true.[A][N]

When the news of your abduction reached us,[N]
the thought of you in danger while I just sat[A][N]
at home was unberable![N]
I came to Yngvi as quickly as I could.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hold on. You are the younger brother of[N]

Did he allow you to come?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

##QuanAyraTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadAyra][OpenMidLeft][LoadQuan]
Princess Ayra of Isaach, I presume?[A][N]
I heard your story story from Sigurd.[N]
I am Quan of Leonster.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A pleasure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd hate to press you for information so soon,[N]
but there's something I'd like to know.[A][N]
Why did Isaach attack Dahna in the first place?[A][N]
Surely you knew doing so would invoke the wrath[N]
of Grannavale.[A][N]
That King Mananan would commit such a[N]
reckless act[...] The very idea defies belief.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You knew my father, Sir Quan?![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm afraid I never had the chance to meet thim.[N]
However , my father knows him well.[A][N]
He's always had only the utmost praise for him.[A][N]
He also speaks fondly of your brother,[N]
Prince Mariccle.[A][N]
He's always said he is a fine young man.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is that so? It heartens me to hear it.[A][N]
Without a doubt, my father and Mariccle[N]
were admirable men.[A][N]
Never would they condone such an assault[N]
on a defenseless city.[A][N]
In the matter of Dahna, the patriarch of Ribaut[N]
acted alone and without our consent[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I beg your pardon?![N]
Why haven't the Grannavalians heard this?[A][N]
Surely if Prince Kurth knew the truth,[N]
he would refuse to continue the war.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So, too, thought my father.[A][N]
Once he executed the Ribaut patriarch,[N]
he departed for the Grannavale front, head in tow,[A][N]
to negotiate with them.[N]
But[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Yes?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
My father, the king[...][N]
He was assassinated on the way.[A][N]
Once word of this returned to Isaach,[N]
the people were utterly incensed.[A][N]
Mariccle set out, leading our entire army,[N]
seeking vengeance against Grannavale.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Something is amiss here.[A][N]
The murder of a king who seeks peace talks[N]
certainly isn't like Prince Kurth, either.[A][N]
Have you told Sigurd of this as well?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No. Lord Sigurd carries enough of a burden[N]
as it is. It's too late for my brother[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Prince Mariccle was resigned to his death[N]
when he engaged Grannvale, wasn't he[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
My brother believed to the last that Isaach's hope[N]
for the future rests in Shannan, his son.[A][N]
My role is to protect Shannan, and with him,[N]
the promise of Isaach's liberty[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see. Thank you for telling me, Princess Ayra.[A][N]
Someday, the worls will know this truth,[N]
and till that day comes, you mustn't give in.[A][N]
I will do all I can to help you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you, Sir Quan.[A][X]

Lord Sigurd, is it?[N]
What's the matter?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh[...] You must be the twon elder![N]
That woman who ran off just now[...][A][N]
Do you know who she is?[A][N]
Ahh, of course.[N]
That woman is called Deirdre.[A][N]
She is a priestess of the spirit forest.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Deirdre[...][N]
She's beautiful[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ohoho, even a refined man like you[N]
can't resist being charmed by her ilk![A][N]
Could it be love at first sight? Hoho[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sir, please. Don't tease me.[A][N]
And yet[...] I've never seen anybody so beautiful[N]
before. I[...] I need to see her again.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alas, sir, for it cannot be so.[A][N]
The folk of the spirit forest staunchly refuse to[N]
partake in the world beyond their woods.[A][N]
Furthermore, that girl and members of her clan[N]
are forbidden from ever liasing with men.[A][N] 
Village lore dictates that should this ever happen,[N]
calamity would befall the world.[A][N]
You have no choice, sir.[N]
Resign yourself of that girl.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What superstitious nonsense![A][N]
That poor girl[...][N]

However, the Cross Knights[N]

everything under control.[A][X]

##JamkeLastPersuasion
[OpenMidRight][LoadBatu][OpenMidLeft][LoadJamke]
Father, this is absurd![N]
Why do you still refuse to listen to me?[A][N]
My brothers already have fallen,[N]
and it's only a matter of time before[A][N]
they come for the capital as well.[A][N]
The Grannavale commander, Sir Sigurd,[N]
is a good man.[A][N]
Please, end the war while you still can![A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[...] allowed Munnir's raid only because[A][N]
I'd been told that Grannavale[N]
would surely come to invade us first.[A][N]
Never did I intend for a war like this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It was that sorcerer, Sandima, who told you[N]
that, wasn't it?[A][N]
You, Cimbaeth, and Munnir trusted him too[N]
readily. You've all been deceived![A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadBatu][OpenFarRight][LoadSandima]
Now, now, Prince Jamke.[N]
That's enough of that.[A][N]
Your duty as prince is to lead your men[N]
into the fray.[A][N]
Dawdling in a place like this would[N]
be deeply troublesome of you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Argh! Damn you, Sandima![A][N][OpenRight]
That's enough, Jamke. Listen to Sandima.[N]
Go. Lead your men into the fray.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Father![N]
[...]Very well.[A][N]
If you won't change your mind, even now,[N]
then[...] I'll see this through as well.[A][N]
But be warned.[A][N]
Should I return victorious, Sandima,[N]
I'll allow you to live no longer![A][X]

##VerdaneShenanigans
[OpenMidRight][LoadSandima][OpenMidLeft][LoadBatu]
Sandima[...][A][N]
Perhaps, for all this time, you may not have[N]
been entirely forthright with me.[A][N]
You did assure me that Grannavale hungers to[N]
claim our land, and yet[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Feh[...] And what are you saying now?[A][N]
To think, I believed that you Verdanites would be[N]
of use[...] You truly are naught but savages.[A][N]
You are worthless.[A][N]
Completely and utterly worthless![N]
And from now on, your army is mine to command![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What?! No, stay back![N]
Back, I- -Guhh[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
Feh[...] Feeble-minded old fool.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadManfroy]
So, you've put an end to the king, Sandima[...][A][N]
Do you expect that the Verdanite army will still[N]
obey your command?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh, Archbishop Manfroy![ToggleSmile][N]
How long have you been here, Your Eminence?[A][N]
The army is of no concern at all.[N]
They need only to know that the king has fallen ill.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hrm, I see[...][A][N]
And what of the situation here?[N]
Does the plan progress?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
My sincerest apologies, Your Excellency.[A][N]
That Grannvalian[...][N]
Sigurd, or something,[A][N]
has proven to be an unexpected obstacle[N]
to the invasion.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[...] And what of the search for the Loptrian[N]
scion? Have you found Cigyun's daughter?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Er[...] No, not yet[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Imbecile![A][N]
After all of the pains I have gone to,[N]
to locate the boy[...][A][N]
The son of Cigyun is still in Belhalla,[N]
but he's worthless without the female.[A][N]
Listen well. Cigyun was an eir of Prince Maera,[N]
brother of an emperor of the Loptrian Empire.[A][N]
Cigyun alone in this era inherited the sacred blood[N]
of the dark lord.[A][N]
That woman broke the commandment that Maera[N]
placed upon his heirs and bore two children.[A][N]
Do you know what this means?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yes, Your Eminence.[A][N]
When the blood of the two heirs intersects, the second[N]
coming of the dark lord, Loptous, will be upon us.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Precisely, and so too shall we, descendants of[N]
the Loptrian Empire, return to this world.[A][N]
You know as well as I, Sandima,[N]
how heavily our fates depend upon[A][N]
the resurrection of the dark lord.[A][N]
You know well our order's centuries of exile,[N]
hidden deep within the Aed Desert.[A][N]
You know well the abuses[...] The famines[...][A][N]
How we were sustained only by dreaming of[N]
the day when the Empire will rise again.[A][N]
And at long last, that day is upon us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Understood, Your Eminence.[A][N]
If I must surrender my life to ensure that[N]
the plan is realized, I will do it gladly![A][X]

##EldiganConfrontsElliot

Elliot![A][N]
Ambushing them like a[N]

A cowardly act, ill befitting[N]
the honor of a knight![A][N]
Withdraw immediately, or I will take action.[N]
We both know you're no match for me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's this? Eldigan?![A][N]
I should've known you would[N]
side with Grannavale![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
In doing this you are crossing not[N]
just Grannavale, nor me, but your very liege![A][N]
We bow to the reverent King Imca,[N]
who desires only peace with Grannavale.[A][N]
Would you truly cross His Majesty?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You fool![A][N]
Only you would still seriously heed that senile[N]
old fool's word.[A][N]
The lords of Agustria are united against[N]
both Grannavale and any peace with them![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Wrong, for I will not stand with you![A][N]
Agustria cannot afford the crippling tolls of war,[N]
and nor can Grannavale.[A][N]
Our past stands as a testament to this.[A][N]
Learn well, Elliot: we, the nobility, know not[N]
the suffering brought by war.[A][N]
War cripples only the powerless, our subjects.[A][N]
I will not abide your lust for glory[N]
at the expense of our people![A][N][OpenMidRight]
A pretty little speech, but that won't save[N]
you now.[A][N]
I knew all along: you and I[N]
were always fated to clash, Eldigan![A][N]
Today, we settle this once and for all![A][N]

Are all who were summoned in attendance?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Yes, my dear father.[A][N]
Lord Bordeaux stands before you[N]
aside Lords Macbeth, Othello, and Clement.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Yes, I do apologize.[A][N]
It's getting harder to[N]
see clear in my old age.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I am your humble servant.[A][N]
I shall aid you in[N]
all matters of government.[A][N][OpenLeft]
It's come to my attention that a Grannvale army[N]
led by Sigurd of Chalphy has[N]
crossed Verdane's border to wage war.[A][N][OpenRight]
Your intelligence speaks true, sire.[A][N]
Out of concern for our[N]
own lands I sent my beloved[A][N]
Elliot to assess the[N]
situation for any threats,[A][N]
and he was murdered by Lord Eldigan.[A][N]
As you might know, he is an old friend of[N]
Lord Sigurd and Lord Quan of Lenster,[A][N]
whose forces joined in the assault.[A][N]
Eldigan has shown himself a traitor[N]
to our nation and must hang immediately![A][N][OpenLeft]
That is[...] difficult to accept.[A][N]
The Nordions have always been staunch patriots.[N]
But I promise you, Lord Bordeaux,[A][N]
the matter will be investigated[N]
and resolved accordingly.[A][N]
If justice is due, you shall have it.[N]
Chagall, may I entrust this matter to you?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It would be my honor. Heheheh[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarRight]
Granvale is bloodthirsty.[N]
First Issach, and now Verdane.[A][N]
With their size and number[N]
of Holy Blood heirs,[A][N]
they pose a serious threat.[A][N]
I do believe it would be prudent[N]
to begin marshaling our forces in preparation.[A][X]

##ClementSpeaks
[OpenFarRight][LoadOthello][OpenRight][LoadMacbeth][OpenLeft][LoadClement]
It would be prudent not to act hastily.[N]
My sources say that Verdane acted first.[A][N]
With Lord Byron and the preponderance of his[N]
army that watches the border away at war,[A][N]
Munnir and Cimbaeth capitalized on the[N]
weakness and attacked Jungby,[A][N]
kidnapping Lord Ring's daughter, Edain.[A][N]
That Sigurd and a small entourage[N]
pursued to rescue her.[A][N]
We all know those Verdanians are a[N]
pack of uncouth savages.[A][N]
Our own skirmishes with them over[N]
the years more than prove that.[A][N]
Thieves and rapists, the lot of them![A][N][OpenFarRight]
You've always been a coward, Lord Clement.[N]
Afraid of getting your hands dirty.[A][N]
Always waiting to see who comes out[N]
on top so you might play for favor.[A][N][OpenLeft]
You dare speak to me in such a manner, pup?[A][N]
If Anphony has an opinion of me,[N]
I will hear it from its lord, not the spare.[A][N][OpenRight]
Lord Clement is right, Othello.[N]
You speak out of turn.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
My apologies.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I do not intend to advocate to Grannvale,[A][N]
only to make the point that raising[N]
our armies in such volume could alarm them.[A][N]
If they believe we are preparing for war,[A][N]
Granvale would invade us when they[N]
may not have planned to at all.[A][N]
It would be an invitation to shed blood.[A][X]

##ImcaContinues
[OpenFarLeft][LoadChagall][OpenFarRight][LoadMacbeth][OpenRight][LoadBordeaux][OpenLeft][LoadImca]
Clement speaks wisely.[A][N]
Politics and statesmanship are[N]
such delicate matters.[A][N]
If we show strength, we look weak and afraid.[N]
Wars are won in the shadows.[A][N]
But the best victories are the battles[N]
that never have to be fought.[A][N]
Alas, I do believe we should have some preparedness[N]
should the worst come to pass.[A][N]
We will not bring all of our forces to bear,[A][N]
but you are allowed to prepare[N]
your troops to brace for an attack.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I will coordinate with the lords see to it[N]
that your wishes are carried out, father.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I have been blessed with a fine son.[N]
Someday you will even make a fine king.[A][N]
I shall adjourn this meeting.[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow]

For a moment I thought that I might[N]

Milord, listen. The dark priest Sandima[N]
guards Castle Verdane with his wicked magic.[A][N]
You must go no further. You would surely be killed.[N]
Please, you mustn't go[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Excuse me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This is called a Silence staff.[A][N]
So long as my own power is enough[N]

it will seal his magic away.[A][N]
Trust me, milord.[A][N]

I don't understand.[A][N]
But if you and I feel the same way,[N]
then surely we've nothing to fear.[A][N]

And I thought you promised[N]
to stop thievery![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadDew]
I did, I swear! I joined[N]
Sigurd's army instead.[A][N]
No more thievin around![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadJamke]
Then that makes you[N]
my enemy![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadDew]
Hold on! What about you?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadJamke]
Wh-what do you mean?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadDew]
Didn't you promised Edain[N]
to reason your father?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadJamke]
There's no use[...][A][N]
I'll fight for Verdane[N]
till the end.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadJamke]
Edain[...][N]
we meet again.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadEdain]
Prince Jamke, please[N]
stop fighting.[A][N]
This war is meaningless.[A][N]

talking to your father?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadJamke]

Hold, Prince Jamke![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Edain!?[N]
What are you doing here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You said you would persuade your father, yet[N]
instead you've taken to the field yourself.[A][N]
What is the matter with you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
My father is a changed man.[N]
My words can no longer reach him[...][A][N]
[...]It all started when that sorcerer,[N]
Sandima, arrived.[A][N]
My entire family now obeys his every word.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This is why I ask[...][N]
Why have you taken to the field?[A][N]
Please, Jamke.[N]
Join us. Let's go to Verdane together.[A][N]
We can reason with the king, one more time.[N]
We can put an end to this war![A][N]
Lord Sigurd has no interest in invading[N]
Verdane. He fought only to rescue me.[A][N]
Please listen, Jamke.[N]
Please[...] I beg of you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fine[...] If you're willing to go so far,[N]
then I'll stain my name with treason.[A][N]
But it must be understood that I won't[N]
let anyone lay a finger on my father.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes, I will promise you that.[N]
Thank you, Jamke.[A][N]
You truly are a good person.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

I dropped my axe![A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadLakeGoddess]
What you dropped[...][N]
Was it this golden axe?[A][N]
Or perhaps, this silver axe?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh no. My axe isn't anything as fine[N]
as those two.[A][N]
It's just a plain old iron axe.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Such an honest person[...][A][N]
As a reward[...][N]
I present you with this brave axe[...][N]
Farewell, Lord Lex[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]

##C1_1VillageOne
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadOldWoman]
This village is part of the holdings[N]
of Prince Cimbaeth, lord of Genoa.[A][N]
He's as dreadful as they come![A][N]
Barely a mmonth goes by without him settin'[N]
his army on us. It's terrifyin'![A][N]
King Batu, his father, used to do such a[N]
fine job keepin' him in check.[A][N]
I can hardly imagine what's going on[...][N]
Anyway, glad you stopped by![A][X]

##C1_1VillageTwo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadOldWoman]
King Batu is as gentle as they come.[A][N]
Normally, at least, leading a war like this is[N]
the last thing he'd ever do.[A][N]
Mark my words: this is all the doing of Sandima,[N]
his sorcerous advisor. I can just feel it.[A][N]
Eking out a living here's grown tougher and[N]
tougher since the day that man arrived,[A][N]
and save for the youngest son, Jamke,[N]
both king and country are at his every whim.[A][N]
Please, I beg you[...] Save our country![N]
Bring back the Verdane that once was![A][X]

##C1_2VillageOne
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
Just t'the north a here is this mighty woodland.[N]
S'called the spirit forest.[A][N]
Once upon a time, I lived there too,[N]
in this li'l hamlet deep within.[A][N]
Th' village is home to the last kin o'[N]
the dark one of old, Loptous.[A][N]
They say it all started with Saint Maera,[N]
exiled by the empire for darin' to sympathize[A][N]
with mortal men.[A][N]
In my day, there was this gorgeous girl livin'[N]
there called Cigyun:[A][N]
the last heir o' Loptous's bloodline, she was.[A][N]
She lived 'er life under close guard, the villagers[N]
wary o' lettin' the blood o' Loptous loose into[A][N]
th' world.[A][N]
Alas, Cigyun grew weary o' the tedious forest life an'[N]
she left it all behind, breakin' ancient commandments.[A][N]
A couple of years later, she came back,[N]
'cept now she was pregnant.[A][N]
Never said who the father was, mind.[A][N]
Before long Cigyun died, even as she gave birth[N]
t' her daughter.[A][N]
From what I 'eard, the hamlet's old prophet[N]
took 'er in and raised the girl as 'er own.[A][N]
If the little girl's still alive, she'd 'ave to be[N]
'bout seventeen or eighteen by now[...][A][X]

Sire, we've found a casualty in the palace.[N]
It's[...] it's King Batu himself.[A][N]
He's severely wounded.[N]
By the look of it, he's well beyond help.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadBatu][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight]
King Batu! Are you alright?[N]
Please, come on[...] you can make it![A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
Hnnh[...] Lord[...] Sigurd?[A][N]
I am so sorry for doing all this to you[...][N]
I let Sandima[...] lead me astray[...][A][N]
He[...] he abused my trust[...][N]
and won over my sons[...][A][N]
all to seize control of Verdane for himself[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I understand, You Highness,[N]
but you need to rest now.[A][N]
Please, you mustn't stress yourself further.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No[...] It's too late for me[...][A][N]
Heed my word, Sigurd,[N]
for there is one final thing I must tell you[...][A][N]
The misery here[...][N]
the grief spreading across Jugdral[...][A][N]
it is all the will of the dark priesthood[...][A][N]
They blight our world from the shadows, all[...][N]
all in the name of the revival of the revival of their dark god,[A][N]
Loptous[...][A][N]
Sandima[...] was one of them[...][N]
He twisted us to war with Grannvale[...][A][N]
for the sake of the cult's madness.[A][N]
The[...] the dark priests[...][N]
they infect every corner of our world[...][A][N]
Sigurd[...] Stay bigilant,[N]
lest you be tricked too![A][N]
I[...] I failed the people of Verdane[...][A][N]
Sigurd, I beg you[...][N]
Make this right[...] Protect[...] my[...] people[...][A][N][CloseEyes][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]

They conquered all of Verdane.[N]
They must have some fine fighters.[A][N]

you're here to fight for, right?[A][N]
All I've done is chase the money for all[N]
these years[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But I look at you, and suddenly,[N]
it all feels so meaningless.[A][N]
Hey, I don't suppose you're recruiting?[A][N]
Maybe using my blade for something real[N]

You're an honest man, Prince Jamke.[N]
What will you do now?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I will attend my father's funeral.[A][N]
Then I will be marching with you[N]
to Nordion Castle.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Huh? Are you sure? You're the last[N]
prince of Verdane.[A] Shouldn't you stay[N]
here and lead the country?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No, I'm no good at ruling a country. There[N]
are people far more qualified.[A][N]
It would be best if Verdane were to just[N]
start over.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

Thank you, sir.[A][X]

Please don't do it, brother![A][N]

murdered his father himself.[A][N]
You'll only be endangering yourself[N]

He won't listen to you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You mustn't say such things about your king![A][N]
I, too, have heard the rumors of King Chagall's[N]
involvement, but they are just that:rumors.[A][N]
There remains no evidence against him.[A][N]
Surely, His Majesty will see reason in this matter,[N]
if I simply persuade him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
